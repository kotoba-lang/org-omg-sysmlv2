  "OMG Systems Modeling Language (SysML) v2.0 kernel elements as EDN, built
  on `sysml.kerml`. Zero third-party deps -- portable .cljc. A model is a
  `sysml.kerml` kernel (`{:kerml/elements ... :kerml/relationships ...}`)
  plus a `:sysml/name`; every SysML element this namespace builds IS,
  underneath, a `sysml.kerml` `classifier` or `feature` tagged with
  `:sysml/element-kind`, so `sysml.kerml`'s specialization machinery
  (`specialize`/`all-supertypes`/`specializes?`) works directly on SysML
  Definitions and Usages too.

  **The Definition/Usage duality** (OMG SysML 2.0 Language spec,
  formal/26-03-02; ground-truthed here against the Pilot Implementation's
  `org.omg.sysml.model/src/main/resources/model/SysML.ecore`) is SysML v2's
  central structural idea: a `Definition` is a reusable type (KerML
  `Classifier` specialization, ecore ~L921: `Definition eSuperTypes=
  Classifier`), a `Usage` is an occurrence of one in a context (KerML
  `Feature` specialization, ecore ~L4827: `Usage eSuperTypes=Feature`).
  `Usage.definition` names the Classifiers/Definitions typing a usage
  (ecore ~L4837-4847); `Definition.usage`/`Usage.nestedUsage` name a
  Definition's or Usage's owned Usages (ecore ~L925 / ~L4827 doc). A
  `PartUsage` can itself own nested `PartUsage`s typed by other
  `PartDefinition`s -- e.g. a `Vehicle` PartDefinition nests an `engine`
  PartUsage (typed by an `Engine` PartDefinition), which in turn nests a
  `fuelIn` PortUsage (typed by a `FuelPort` PortDefinition). See the
  `sysml.validate` and README Contract example for exactly this shape.

  Element shape: every element is `{:kerml/kind :classifier|:feature
  :kerml/name _ :sysml/element-kind _ ...}`. A Usage additionally carries
  `:sysml/definition` (the name of the Classifier/Definition typing it) and,
  optionally, `:sysml/nested` (a set of names of Usages -- or, for a
  `:package`, arbitrary member elements -- it structurally contains).

  **v1 simplifications (see README Follow-ups for the full list):**
  - `Usage.definition` (real KerML: `FeatureTyping`, itself a kind of
    `Specialization` -- kerml.ecore ~L1529) is stored here as a direct
    `:sysml/definition` name reference rather than round-tripped through
    `sysml.kerml`'s generic Specialization relationship list. Definition-
    to-Definition (and Usage-to-Usage) generalization chains (e.g. `Car`
    specializes `Vehicle`) DO reuse `sysml.kerml/specialize` +
    `all-supertypes` directly, since that is a straightforward, faithful
    reuse of the kernel's own machinery.
  - Nested-usage ownership (real KerML: `FeatureMembership`, a kind of
    `OwningMembership` -- distinct from `TypeFeaturing`/`Featuring`) is
    likewise a direct `:sysml/nested` name-set rather than
    `sysml.kerml/add-featuring` relationships, for the same directness
    reason. `sysml.kerml`'s `Featuring` remains available and is exercised
    on its own in `sysml.kerml-test` for the generic 'a feature belongs to
    a type' case.
  - `ConnectionDefinition`/`ConnectionUsage` (ecore ~L737/~L753:
    `ConnectionDefinition eSuperTypes=PartDefinition+AssociationStructure`,
    `ConnectionUsage eSuperTypes=ConnectorAsUsage+PartUsage`) are modeled
    here as their own element kinds carrying `:sysml/ends` (a vector of
    connected Port/Part usage names, simplifying the real metamodel's
    `Connector::connectorEnd`/`relatedFeature`/n-ary `ReferenceSubsetting`
    machinery to plain name references). Likewise `InterfaceDefinition`/
    `InterfaceUsage` (ecore: `InterfaceDefinition eSuperTypes=
    ConnectionDefinition`) are modeled as their own sibling kinds rather
    than literally inheriting ConnectionDefinition/Usage's shape.
  - `RequirementDefinition`/`RequirementUsage`'s `requiredConstraint`
    (ecore ~L3647/~L3733: owned `ConstraintUsage`s) are modeled as plain
    constraint-expression strings in `:sysml/required-constraints`, not
    full `ConstraintUsage` elements -- constraint *solving* is out of
    scope entirely (see README), so there is nothing structural gained by
    a richer shape here in v1.
  - `SatisfyRequirementUsage` (ecore ~L3838: `SatisfyRequirementUsage
    eSuperTypes=RequirementUsage+AssertConstraintUsage`) and a `verify`
    counterpart (real KerML: `RequirementVerificationMembership`, which
    ties a `VerificationCase` -- not modeled at all here -- to a
    `RequirementUsage`) are both modeled as lightweight named relationship
    elements (`:satisfy-requirement-usage`/`:verify-requirement-usage`)
    referencing the requirement and the satisfying/verifying usage by
    name, purely for structural traceability -- no verification reasoning
    is performed (see `sysml.validate` `scope-out-problems`)."
