  "OMG Kernel Modeling Language (KerML) 1.0 kernel as EDN. Zero third-party
  deps -- portable .cljc (JVM, ClojureScript, SCI). KerML is the foundation
  layer SysML v2 is built on (OMG KerML 1.0, formal/26-03-01, adopted
  2025-07-21; 'general syntactic constructs for structuring models... core
  semantic constructs... based on classification... additional constructs
  for commonly needed modeling capabilities, such as associations and
  behaviors', per the OMG About-KerML page). This namespace models the six
  concepts `sysml.model` needs to build SysML's Definition/Usage duality on
  top of: `Type` / `Classifier` / `Feature` / `Specialization` / `Featuring`
  / `Multiplicity`.

  A kernel is a plain namespaced-key map:
    {:kerml/elements      {\"Name\" -> element-map}
     :kerml/relationships [relationship-map ...]}

  Elements (:kerml/kind :type|:classifier|:feature) are plain maps you can
  assoc/diff/store. Per the KerML metamodel (Pilot Implementation
  `org.omg.sysml/model/kerml.ecore`, a legitimate ground-truth source per
  this library's own scoping note -- see README):
    - `Classifier` specializes `Type` (kerml.ecore ~L1857/L802: 'Classifier
      eSuperTypes=Type').
    - `Feature` specializes `Type` too (~L1153: 'Feature eSuperTypes=Type')
      -- in KerML a Feature IS a kind of Type, which is what lets a
      `PartUsage` (a Feature, in SysML) itself be specialized/typed just
      like a `PartDefinition` (a Classifier) can.
    - `Multiplicity` specializes `Feature` (~L1748) and gives the allowed
      cardinalities of a typeWithMultiplicity. The real metamodel's bounds
      are themselves `Expression` trees (so a bound can be a computed
      value); this library simplifies bounds to plain integers
      (`:kerml/lower`/`:kerml/upper`) attached directly via
      `with-multiplicity` rather than modeling a nested Expression
      sub-language (v1 scope decision, see README Follow-ups).

  Relationships (:kerml/kind :specialization|:featuring|:conjugation) are
  plain maps appended to `:kerml/relationships`:
    - `Specialization` {:kerml/specific _ :kerml/general _} -- 'a
      Relationship between two Types that requires all instances of the
      specific type to also be instances of the general Type' (kerml.ecore
      ~L770-800, `general`/`specific` references, both lowerBound=1).
    - `Featuring` (KerML's actual metaclass is `TypeFeaturing`)
      {:kerml/feature _ :kerml/featuring-type _} -- 'the Type that features
      the featureOfType' (kerml.ecore ~L1562-1592, `featureOfType`/
      `featuringType`). This library uses `Featuring` as the simple
      belongs-to relation (a Feature belongs to a Type); the real metamodel
      keeps `TypeFeaturing` distinct from ownership (`FeatureMembership`) --
      see README for why `sysml.model` does not route nested-usage
      ownership through this relationship in v1.
    - `Conjugation` {:kerml/conjugated _ :kerml/original _} -- 'the
      conjugatedType inherits all the Features of the originalType, but
      with all input and output Features reversed' (kerml.ecore
      ~L1716-1746, `originalType`/`conjugatedType`).")
